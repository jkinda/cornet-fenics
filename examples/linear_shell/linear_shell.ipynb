    "This tour is dedicated to the implementation of small-strain elastic shell model. In the [fenics-shells project](https://fenics-shells.readthedocs.io), the shell surface is described by a mapping between a parametric 2D domain and the shell initial stress-free configuration. This approach makes it impossible to tackle non-manifold surfaces or closed surfaces for which the mapping would exhibit singularities.\n",

    "In the present implementation, we will instead work directly with the shell surface (either manifold or non-manifold) described as an assembly of planar facets. In this respect, the approach will bear important similarities with the [Elastic 3D beam structures](https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demo/beams_3D/beams_3D.html). In particular, we will take advantage of `UFL` ability to compute gradients over a manifold.\n",

Contrary to the `fenics-shells` approach which uses a global analytical mapping between the reference domain and the shell surface, we use here the reference element mapping of the finite-element method. For a shell, the Jacobian is of size $3\\times 2$ with both columns $\\bt_1,\\bt_2$ being a vector of the local tangent plane. We therefore compute $\\be_3$, the normal to the mid-surface from $\\bt_1\\times \\bt_2$. We then have to choose a convention to compute $\\be_1,\\be_2$, knowing $\\be_3$. Our convention is that $\\be_1$ lies in the plane orthogonal to $\\be_Y$ and $\\be_3$.
