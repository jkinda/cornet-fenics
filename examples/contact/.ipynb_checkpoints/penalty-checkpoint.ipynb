    "# Hertzian contact with a rigid indenter using a penalty approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this numerical tour, we explore the formulation of frictionless contact between a rigid surface (the indenter) and an elastic domain, representing an infinite half-space for the present case. Contact will be solved using a penalty formulation, that is small interpenetration between the solid and the identer will be authorized. Prerequisites for this tour are the formulation of an linear elasticity problem and the resolution of a general nonlinear variational problem."

    "The elastic (isotropic $E,\\nu$) solid will be represented by a 3D cubic domain of unit dimension and contact will take place on its top surface $z=0$, centered at $x=y=0$. Symmetry conditions will be applied on the $x=0$ and $y=0$ surfaces whereas the bottom surface $z=-1$ will be fully fixed. If contact appears on a small region of extent $a\\ll 1$, the problem can then be considered to be a good approximation of contact on a semi-infinite domain.\n",

We will also consider that the indenter radius $R$ is sufficiently large with respect to the contact region characteristic size $a$ so that the spherical surface can be approximated by a parabola. In this case, the distance between such an indenter and the top surface can be written as:\n",
