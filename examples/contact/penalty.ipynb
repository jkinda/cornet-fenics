    "# Hertzian contact with a rigid indenter using a penalty approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this numerical tour, we explore the formulation of frictionless contact between a rigid surface (the indenter) and an elastic domain, representing an infinite half-space for the present case. Contact will be solved using a penalty formulation, that is small interpenetration between the solid and the indenter will be authorized. Prerequisites for this tour are the formulation of an linear elasticity problem and the resolution of a general nonlinear variational problem. See for instance:\n",
