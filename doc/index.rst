Welcome to Numerical tours of Computational Mechanics using FEniCS
==================================================================

In the following you will find documented demos of FEniCS scripts implementing
various computational mechanics models. The full set of demos can be obtained
from the COmputational MEchanics Toolbox (COMET) available at
