    "# Periodic homogenization of linear materials\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tour will show how to perform periodic homogenization of linear elastic materials. The considered 2D plane strain problem deals with a skewed unit cell of dimensions $1\\times \\sqrt{3}/2$ consisting of circular inclusions (numbered $1$) of radius $R$ with elastic properties $(E_r, \\nu_r)$ and embedded in a matrix material (numbered $0$) of properties $(E_m, \\nu_m)$ following an hexagonal pattern. A classical result of homogenization theory ensures that the resulting overall behavior will be isotropic, a property that will be numerically verified later. We suggest reading first the following tour [2D linear elasticity](../elasticity/2D_elasticity.py.html)."

    "## Periodic homogenization framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of homogenization theory consists in computing the apparent elastic moduli of the homogenized medium associated with a given microstructure. In a linear elastic setting, this amounts to solving the following auxiliary problem defined on the unit cell $\\mathcal{A}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\begin{cases}\\operatorname{div} \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{0} & \\text{in } \\mathcal{A} \\\\ \n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathbb{C}(\\boldsymbol{y}):\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} & \\text{for }\\boldsymbol{y}\\in\\mathcal{A} \\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\boldsymbol{E} + \\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{v} & \\text{in } \\mathcal{A} \\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{v} & \\text{is } \\mathcal{A}\\text{-periodic} \\\\\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{T}=\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n} & \\text{is } \\mathcal{A}\\text{-antiperiodic}\n",
    "\\end{cases} \\label{auxiliary-problem}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{E}$ is the **given** macroscopic strain, $\\boldsymbol{v}$ a periodic fluctuation and $\\mathbb{C}(\\boldsymbol{y})$ is the heterogeneous elasticity tensor depending on the microscopic space variable $\\boldsymbol{y}\\in\\mathcal{A}$. By construction, the local microscopic strain is equal on average to the macroscopic strain: $\\langle \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\rangle = \\boldsymbol{E}$. Upon defining the macroscopic stress $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ as the microscopic stress average: $\\langle \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\rangle = \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$, there will be a linear relationship between the auxiliary problem loading parameters $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and the resulting average stress:\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}  = \\mathbb{C}^{hom}:\\boldsymbol{E} \\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{C}^{hom}$ represents the apparent elastic moduli of the homogenized medium. Hence, its components can be computed by solving elementary load cases corresponding to the different components of $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and performing a unit cell average of the resulting microscopic stress components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total displacement as the main unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous problem can also be reformulated by using the total displacement $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\boldsymbol{E}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{y} + \\boldsymbol{v}$ as the main unknown with now $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\nabla^s \\boldsymbol{u}$. The periodicity condition is therefore equivalent to the following constraint: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}  \n",
    "\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{y}^+)-\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{y}^-) = \\boldsymbol{E}\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{y}^+-\\boldsymbol{y}^-)\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{y}^{\\pm}$ are opposite points on the unit cell boundary related by the periodicity condition. This formulation is widely used in solid mechanics FE software as it does not require specific change of the problem formulation but just adding tying constraints between some degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation is however not easy to translate in FEniCS. It would indeed require introducing Lagrange multipliers defined on some part of the border only, a feature which does not seem to be available at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Periodic fluctuation as the main unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will keep the initial formulation and consider the periodic fluctuation $\\boldsymbol{v}$ as the main unknown. The periodicity constraint on $\\boldsymbol{v}$ will be imposed in the definition of the associated FunctionSpace using the ``constrained_domain`` optional keyword. To do so, one must define the periodic map linking the different unit cell boundaries. Here the unit cell is 2D and its boundary is represented by a parallelogram of vertices ``vertices`` and the corresponding base vectors `a1` and `a2` are computed. The right part is then mapped onto the left part, the top part onto the bottom part and the top-right corner onto the bottom-left one."
